# Inventory Data Visualization and Summary

This Python script is designed to visualize and summarize the inventory dataset generated by the `generate_inventory_dataset.py` script. It provides detailed visualizations for each SKU (Stock Keeping Unit) and generates a comprehensive summary of the dataset, including statistics, missing values, and correlations. Additionally, it creates an interactive HTML report using `ydata_profiling`.

## Requirements

To run this script, you need the following Python libraries:

- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `ydata_profiling`

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn ydata_profiling
```

## Installation
1. Clone the repository or download the script to your local machine.
2. Ensure that the `inventory_dataset.parquet` file is available in the same directory as the script.

## Usage
To visualize and summarize the inventory dataset, simply run the script:
```bash
python visualize_inventory_data.py
```

This will generate visualizations for each SKU, print summary statistics, and create an HTML report named `inventory_report.html`.

## HTML Report
The script generates an interactive HTML report using ydata_profiling. This report provides an in-depth analysis of the dataset, including:
- **Overview**: General information about the dataset.
- **Variables**: Detailed analysis of each variable.
- **Interactions**: Correlation and interaction between variables.
- **Missing Values**: Analysis of missing values.
- **Sample**: A sample of the dataset.

The report is saved as `inventory_report.html`.
